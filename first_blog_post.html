<h1>First Blog Post, Please (Don&rsquo;t) Ignore</h1>

<h2>January 8th, 2021</h2>

<p>Last summer I learned the hard way
the true importance of oral and written communication, and
my ineptness in the ability to communicate (especially in
a remote environment).
So in a bout of introspective thought,
I came up with the idea of maintaining a professional
blog.
The essence of what this blog will actually be is a place
for me to post selected set of journal entries that is meant
to express myself honestly, yet in a professional capacity.
It also will serve as a medium for me to practice
writing more better-er in this professional capacity.</p>

<p>I also hope that this blog will serve as a professional
organization tool for me. I can publish certain tech
ideas and post updates to certain personal projects that
I&rsquo;m doing now or plan on doing in the near future.
I can even use this small corner of the internet as a
space to publish my own articles and tutorials on how
to use some of the more arcane software tools or languages
that I use. That&rsquo;s not to mention other non-tech things
that I&rsquo;m pretty passionate about, such as artistic analysis
or book reviews.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s to a new hobby.
To a new way for me to try to practice effective written
communication.
To a way of expressing myself open and honestly.
To a way to show off my expertise.
And, of course, to a new year. Despite recent events</p>

<p>I maintain a deep internal optimistic outlook on things, and
I hope you still do as well.</p>
