## Who am I

I am finishing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science
at Umass Lowell. I am passionate about embedded systems
programming, especially in real-time environments.

I have professional experience in flight software testing
for aerospace as well as experience in REST API development.
I was also part of the UML team in the 2020 NECCDC
regional competition.
