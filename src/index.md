## Who am I

I am a senior in Computer Science
at Umass Lowell. Shortly after starting a Umass Lowell,
I started interning at Draper where I developed my understanding
of real-time systems programming for the aerospace industry.
Currently I am working on finishing my degree in Computer Science
and want to continue exploring my passion for real-time software
engineering.

### Professional work includes
* REST API developer for Red Hat
* Embedded software tester for Draper

### Relevant other work includes
* Improvements to Fedora on the RPI
* [NECCDC](https://neccdl.org/neccdc/) team member
* Web and Android developer for the iSense project at the University
of Massachusetts Lowell
* This very website's [static page generator](https://github.com/Codom/Codom.github.io)
